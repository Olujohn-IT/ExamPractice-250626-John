What size of USB key have to be used?
---
For creating a bootable USB drive, a minimum of __8GB__ is generally recommended
but 16GB or larger is preferable for most modern operating systems and to accommodate updates and extra tools. 
While 8GB might suffice for the core installation files, larger drives offer more flexibility and ensure enough space for a smoother experience. 

Can you do multiple boots from one USB key?
---
Yes, it is possible to create a multi-boot USB drive that allows you to boot from multiple operating systems or tools.
This is achieved by using specialized software to create a bootable USB with multiple ISO files,
This is often referred to as a __multiboot USB__.
